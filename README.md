### [1. Credit Card Fraud Detection (Classification)](classificacao-fraudes/identificando-fraudes-cartao.ipynb)
This project focuses on building a classification model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. It applies data preprocessing techniques, class balancing methods, and compares multiple Machine Learning algorithms in order to achieve the best possible performance.

### [2. House Price Prediction (Regression)](precificacao-casas/precificando-casas.ipynb)
Based on property features (e.g., area, number of floors, etc.), a regression model is built to estimate the optimal price for future properties. The project covers techniques such as transformation of skewed variables, feature scaling, and graphical analysis of residual distributions.
